# Covid-19-dashboard

Goals
- instead of circles we want to shade the country
- make a server so that it can auto update data
- make a death count, recovered count and sick count per country



04-26-2020
- looked over Mr.Hoels code
- got new data - (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/04-25-2020.csv)
- brainstormed desired features
- decided on country shading
- found inspo - https://covidlivecount.com/
- researched tools into country shading (chloroplth map) - https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-guide-to-an-interactive-geographical-map-using-python-f4c5197e23e0
- investigated compatiblity with leaflet
- next step- write the python part(pandas,geopandas,leaflet and Geojson) 

05-03-2020
- looked into the chloroplth map and pulled "null" code
- understood the code of "null"
- Ran it to make sure that it worked
- look to see what parts were usefull to us and what part was not- (the part that was not was the bokeh)
- broke her code into chuncks and started annotationg it and tweaking it so that it matched my end goal

next weeks goal
- the goal for next week is to fully adapt code in which we can hand it off a file to leaflet
